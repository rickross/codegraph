## CodeGraph

CodeGraph builds a semantic knowledge graph of codebases for faster, smarter code exploration.

### If \`.codegraph/\` exists in the project

**Use codegraph tools for faster exploration.** These tools provide instant lookups via the code graph instead of scanning files:

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| \`search\` | Find symbols by name (functions, classes, types) |
| \`context\` | Get relevant code context for a task |
| \`callers\` | Find what calls a function |
| \`callees\` | Find what a function calls |
| \`impact\` | See what's affected by changing a symbol |
| \`node\` | Get details + source code for a symbol |

**When spawning Explore agents in a codegraph-enabled project:**

Tell the Explore agent to use codegraph tools for faster exploration.

**For quick lookups in the main session:**
- Use \`search\` instead of grep for finding symbols
- Use \`callers\`/\`callees\` to trace code flow
- Use \`impact\` before making changes to see what's affected

### If \`.codegraph/\` does NOT exist

At the start of a session, ask the user if they'd like to initialize CodeGraph:

"I notice this project doesn't have CodeGraph initialized. Would you like me to run \`codegraph init -i\` to build a code knowledge graph?"
